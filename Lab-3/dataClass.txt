dataclass: 

1-  is a powerful feature in Python that simplifies the creation of classes used for storing data. 
    It reduces boilerplate code and enhances readability, making it easier to work with data-centric classes.


2 - it is a decorator that simplifies the creation of classes by automatically generating special methods.
    without using dataclasses we will need to define the methods manually making the code more repetitive

example:

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: int = 0
    y: int = 0

3- Type Annotations: dataclass requires type annotations for all fields, which helps with type checking and readability.

4- Field Customization: You can customize fields using the field() function from the dataclasses module.
   This allows you to set default values, default factories, and other options:
